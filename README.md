# Chinese Relative Title Calculator

A React web application to calculate how to address relatives in Chinese.

Inspired by the existing android application [Âß®Â™ΩÂßëÂßê](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.igears.relativesa&hl=en)
but expanded to include Cantonese translations and audio output for english users. Family titles are taken from the video by [Off the Great Wall](https://youtu.be/nCFRoILS1jY).

The basic skeleton of the application taken from [Nitin Patel's React calculator tutorial](https://github.com/niinpatel/calculator-react). Speech synthesis made with [npm speak-tts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/speak-tts).
